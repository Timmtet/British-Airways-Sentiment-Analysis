British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.


As a data scientist at BA, the job is to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This project is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

The first task completed was the scarping of review data from the web. For this, the website used is called Skytrax. The data was Scrapped using BeautifulSoup. After scaping, the data was prepared. The data was very messy and contain purely text. Various data cleaning techniques was applied to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, several operations were performed to uncover some insights. 

Futher analysis that was carried out includes sentiment analysis and  wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.
